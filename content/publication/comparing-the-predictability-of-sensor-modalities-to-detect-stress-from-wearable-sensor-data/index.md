title: Comparing the Predictability of Sensor Modalities to Detect Stress from
  Wearable Sensor Data
abstract: Detecting stress from wearable sensor data enables those struggling
  with unhealthy stress coping mechanisms to better manage their stress.
  Previous studies have investigated how mechanisms for detecting stress from
  sensor data can be optimized, comparing alternative algorithms and approaches
  to find the best possible outcome. One strategy to make these mechanisms more
  accessible is to reduce the number of sensors that wearable devices must
  support. Reducing the number of sensors will enable wearable devices to be a
  smaller size, require less battery, and last longer, making use of these
  wearable devices more accessible. To progress towards this more convenient
  stress detection mechanism, we investigate how learning algorithms perform on
  singular modalities and compare the outcome with results from multiple
  modalities. We found that singular modalities performed comparably or better
  than combined modalities on two stress-detection datasets, suggesting that
  there is promise for detecting stress with fewer sensor requirements. Our
  results are acquired from testing with random holdout and
  leave-one-subject-out validation, using several machine learning techniques.
  Our results can inspire work on optimizing stress detection with singular
  modalities to make the benefits of these detection mechanisms more convenient.
