title: Transfer Learning for Activity Recognition in Mobile Health
abstract: While activity recognition from inertial sensors holds potential for
  mobile health, differences in sensing platforms and user movement patterns
  cause performance degradation. Aiming to address these challenges, we propose
  a transfer learning framework, TransFall1 ,for sensor-based activity
  recognition. TransFall’s design contains a two-tier data transformation, a
  label estimation layer, and a model generation layer to recognize activities
  for the new scenario. We validate TransFall analytically and empirically.
