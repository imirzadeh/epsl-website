title: "TransNet: Minimally-Supervised Deep Transfer Learning for Dynamic
  Adaptation of Wearable Systems"
abstract: Wearables are poised to transform health and wellness through
  automation of cost-effective, objective, and real-time health monitoring.
  However, machine learning models for these systems are designed based on
  labeled data collected, and feature representations engineered, in controlled
  environments. This approach has limited scalability of wearables because (i)
  collecting and labeling sufficiently large amounts of sensor data is a
  labor-intensive and expensive process; and (ii) wearables are deployed in
  highly dynamic environments of the end-users whose context undergoes
  consistent changes. We introduce TransNet, a deep learning framework that
  minimizes the costly process of data labeling, feature engineering, and
  algorithm retraining by constructing a scalable computational approach.
  TransNet learns general and reusable features in lower layers of the framework
  and quickly reconfigures the underlying models from a small number of labeled
  instances in a new domain, such as when the system is adopted by a new user or
  when a previously unseen event is to be added to event vocabulary of the
  system. Utilizing TransNet on four activity datasets, TransNet achieves an
  average accuracy of 88.1% in cross-subject learning scenarios using only one
  labeled instance for each activity class. This performance improves to an
  accuracy of 92.7% with five labeled instances.
