abstract: "The current research is designed as a proof-of-concept study to
  establish the feasibility of using a wearable sensor device to provide
  continuous monitoring of stress in an ambulatory setting. Toward that end, we
  first established the validity of two continuously-monitored physiological
  signals, electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV),
  collected from a wearable sensor device. Next, we examined associations
  between the statistical features extracted from the EDA and HRV signals and
  patient-reported outcomes."
