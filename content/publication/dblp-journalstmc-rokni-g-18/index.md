abstract: Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered
  Internet-of-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning
  algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and
  medical complications. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of current
  wearables is that their computational algorithms need to be re-built from
  scratch upon any changes in the configuration. Retraining of these algorithms
  requires significant amount of labeled training data, a process that is
  labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose an approach for automatic
  retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for
  any labeled training data. We measure the inherent correlation between
  observations made by an old sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and
  the new sensor view for which an algorithm needs to be developed. Our
  multi-view learning approach can be used in both online and batch modes. By
  applying the autonomous multi-view learning in the batch mode, we achieve an
  accuracy of 83.7 percent in activity recognition which is an improvement of
  9.3 percent due to the automatic labeling of the data in the new sensor node.
  In addition to gain the less computation advantage of incremental training,
  the online learning algorithm results in an accuracy of 82.2 percent in
  activity recognition.
