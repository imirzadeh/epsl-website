abstract: Wearable sensory devices are becoming the enabling technology for many
  applications in healthcare and well-being, where computational elements are
  tightly coupled with the human body to monitor specific events about their
  subjects. Classification algorithms are the most commonly used machine
  learning modules that detect events of interest in these systems. The use of
  accurate and resource-efficient classification algorithms is of key importance
  because wearable nodes operate on limited resources on one hand and intend to
  recognize critical events (e.g., falls) on the other hand. These algorithms
  are used to map statistical features extracted from physiological signals onto
  different states such as health status of a patient or type of activity
  performed by a subject. Conventionally selected features may lead to rapid
  battery depletion, mainly due to the absence of computing complexity criterion
  while selecting prominent features. In this paper, we introduce the notion of
  power-aware feature selection, which aims at minimizing energy consumption of
  the data processing for classification applications such as action
  recognition. Our approach takes into consideration the energy cost of
  individual features that are calculated in real-time. A graph model is
  introduced to represent correlation and computing complexity of the features.
  The problem is formulated using integer programming and a greedy approximation
  is presented to select the features in a power-efficient manner. Experimental
  results on thirty channels of activity data collected from real subjects
  demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce energy consumption of
  the computing module, resulting in more than 30 percent energy savings while
  achieving 96.7 percent classification accuracy.
