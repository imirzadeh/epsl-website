abstract: Designing remote health monitoring systems requires a multi-faceted
  perspective that takes into account requirements and contexts imposed by the
  medical application, technology, and end-user. We study such a design
  perspective in the context of remote and real-time edema monitoring. Edema
  (accumulation of fluid in certain soft-tissues) is regarded as one of the most
  important symptoms for systematic diseases such as heart failure. Monitoring
  edema allows patients and caregivers to understand the state of sickness and
  effectiveness of the treatments. This article proposes a novel low-power
  context-aware and real-time wearable platform capable of continuous assessment
  of ankle edema in remote settings. Our system keeps track of changes in
  subject's ankle circumference as well as current body posture. An examination
  of our system with 15 subjects demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability
  of the proposed force-sensitive-resistor-based edema sensor (with an R2 of
  0.87 for our regression model and intra-class correlation of 0.97) as well as
  an over 96 percent accuracy in activity monitoring that provide the means to
  perform reliable data validation on ankle circumference measurements in a
  continuous manner. Furthermore, we devise a novel derivative-free power
  optimization approach to maximize the battery lifetime resulting in
  improvement in battery lifetime by a factor of 2.13.
