summary: Stress and challenges associated with stress management are prevalent problems of modern life. Many physical and mental health problems are driven by or escalate with the degree of stress. Stress has deleterious effects among those who suffer from mental and physical health problems. Therefore a comprensive study of stress and effects of stress is an important topic of research in mobile health domain. Our research lies at the junction of sensor systems and machine learning in which we research methods of detecting stress in real-life settings. We use wearable sensor systems to capture bio-markers of stress and design and develop machine learning algorithms for stress detection and classification. The goal of our research is to develop tools, methodologies, and algorithms towards comprehensive approaches to stress detection and inventing smart interventions strategies to promote well-being of an individuals.
