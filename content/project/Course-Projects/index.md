    It is crucial to provide emergency treatment for elderly or patients when they fall over. It is also important to provide warnings if the user has a high risk of falls due to abnormal gait. This project develops a real-time gait monitoring and fall detection system that integrates wearable inertial sensors and embedded machine learning while generating real-time feedback when falls are detected.

    Accurate estimation of activity types is central to human behavior modeling, activity-based interventions, and context-aware system design. We created an activity detection device using embedded machine learning using and Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense. This device can detect if a person is walking, jogging, using stairs or standing still, along with the duration of time they are doing the activity. Data was collected for each activity using the Arduino BLE connection and cleaned. A model was trained using Tensorflow. This trained model was used for real time testing with the Arduino BLE connected to a central. The central used bleak to detect the activity and record the duration of the activity.

    This project builds a system to detect abnormal breathing, coughs, and sneezes. The system differentiate abnormal breathing, coughs, and sneezes from normal breathing using Arduino and machine learning.

    In comparison to the primary grid, microgrids are significantly more sensitive to local changes due to reduced local reserve generation and the switching of loads that make up a comparatively larger percentage of the total load. Given this sensitivity, it is critical for grid controllers to monitor local disruptions (i.e., sudden increase or decrease in load or generation) that the grid is experiencing. This work proposes a low-power phasor measurement unit (PMU) paired with an Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense to classify a variety of disturbances on a simulated microgrid. The low-power low-cost solution makes such a system easier to implement in existing and future microgrids.
